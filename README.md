# Html_Highlighter
This project offers a fancy solution to an interview technical challenge (highlight the 
html tags by the order of enclosure) provided by some financial institution (sorry, I cannot say its name here). 

It complies the code standards to develop a tiny app so that you can see a single class for the command line tool development and junit tests included.
Feel free to use it for reference but do not copy from it directly which may break the code of ethics.

Remember that the basic idea is, using the data structure, __'STACK'__, to __'First In'__ and __'Last Out'__ the html tags!
Then you would be fine with dealing with this challenge. Good luck, friends!	٩(◕‿◕｡)۶
